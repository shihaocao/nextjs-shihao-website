<!-- # Gentle Reminders -->
### 12/10/2024

When things are busy or tough, its easy to forget these. Try to leave space for them :).

_If everything is important, nothing is important.
True, but everything can be important at their own times._

One thing I made a mistake on is a established a strict ordering on what was more important than what.
I took a fall in one place, and let it set the motto until the banner fell.

I mean, banners like that can work, for long times. But times change, and we must grow with the times.

Everything can be important, and you should adjust your love as needed.
