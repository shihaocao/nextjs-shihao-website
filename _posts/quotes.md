I find myself hanging onto a few quotes and principles, this is my attempt to organize all of them. One day, I’ll figure out what I stand for haha.

### Life

- If it's guaranteed, it's guaranteed to fail
    - I kinda made this one up, it’s a sort of manifestation of the “complacency is the only enemy”
    - Every time I thought I had something in the bag, it was because I didn’t know enough about the ways that it could fail
- Go where your people are
    - I’ve tried optimizing my life for materialistic things, and it kinda just sucks. All of it boils back down to a Faustian Bargain
- The biggest risk we face is the risk of not living a fulfilling life (not the risk of failure)
    - Heard this from John Koelliker, at Contrary Retreat 2022

### Engineering

- Ideas are useless, execution is everything.
- All motivation issues stem from a lack of value provided by the work being done
    - A more nuanced case is that the value is not being perceived
- Plans are worthless, planning is everything
    - This was the first line on my onboarding page at SpaceX manufacturing
    - My manager had a copy of *The Toyota Way* on his desk haha, great man
- You have to seek feedback!
    - You don’t know what you don’t know
- Complacency is the only enemy
    - One of the many phrases that Elon would frequently repeat at work
- It is 10x harder to build the machine that builds the machine
    - It’s 100x harder to build the team that builds the machine that builds the machine
    - Invest in your people :)
- Everything always wants to be a high-volume product
    - Even the lowest volume things (like rockets) actually would love to be high volume. More rockets mean more test articles mean safer rockets.
