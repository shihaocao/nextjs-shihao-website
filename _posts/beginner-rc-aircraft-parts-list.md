### Preface

I first made this spreadsheet for my former girlfriend's little brother. I wanted to make it a bit more approachable to getting started in the remote control aircraft hobby. Even though Flite Test offers kits, not all builders know all the other tiny handy parts and equipment you might need to finish the build!

But fear not! This equipment list will have you covered. The only thing it assumes you already have is excitement to make something fly. :)

### The parts list

Here's the google spreadsheet!

### Notes

This parts list should have everything you need to have a good time building, but not splurge on things you don't actually need.

I picked the FT-22 since it looks really cool and is really easy to build. The one downside is it's a bit closer to intermediate for flying skill level, so make sure you put in some time on the simulator!
Alternatively, you could try building the FT-Trainer Instead. The aircraft parts will change, but the equipment list is still relevant!
